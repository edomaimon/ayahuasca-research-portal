### Duplicate Detection

Before adding any article, check for:
1. **Same DOI** already in database
2. **Same PMID** already in database
3. **Same title** (fuzzy match — check first 8 words)
4. **Same data, different paper** — e.g., Palhano-Fontes RCT generated multiple secondary analyses; all are valid separate entries
5. **Preprint vs published** — only include the final published version

### Quality Thresholds for Inclusion

**Must include (if verified):**
- Any RCT involving ayahuasca (regardless of journal impact)
- Any study with N > 100 participants
- Any systematic review or meta-analysis
- Papers with 100+ citations
- Papers in high-impact journals (Nature, Lancet, NEJM, JAMA, etc.)

**Should include:**
- Papers in mid-tier journals with 20+ citations
- Novel methodology or first-of-kind studies
- Papers by established ayahuasca researchers
- Safety/toxicology data (always important)

**Consider carefully:**
- Single case reports (only if uniquely informative)
- Conference proceedings (usually skip unless landmark)
- Papers with < 10 citations from > 3 years ago
- Papers from journals not indexed in PubMed
